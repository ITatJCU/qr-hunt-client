        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-user"></i> How is the game ranked? </h4>

        <p>Each player has a <em>collected</em> number of scans linked to their player id, and a time stamp for each.
            The server tasked with tracking all players compares the total number of codes <em>collected</em> and a
            duration of time between the first and last code scanned.</p>

        <p>The players with the most scans in the shortest period of time are ranked highest.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-qrcode"></i> What if I scan the same code twice? </h4>

        <p>In most cases, nothing, but the game keeps track of the time between the first and last unique
            scans, so rescanning the first or last code will shorten or lengthen your time respectively.</p>

        <p><em>Find all the codes and race between them to reduce your time!</em></p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Why don't I need an account? </h4>

        <p>The Web client generates a universally unique identifier (UUID) and stores it locally on the device using a
            cookie. Every time the application is reloaded, the cookie containing the UUID is restored and associated
            player information is retrieved.</p>

        <p>This technique is often used by mobile advertisers to generate targeted advertisements.</p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Is this a student project?</h4>

        <p>We came up with a rough idea in a brainstorming session, then a motivated student volunteered to implement
            QRHunt as a pet project.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> So, I could learn to do this?</h4>

        <p>Absolutely! JCU's Bachelor of Information Technology teaches the sort of skills and attitudes needed and used
            by the developer of QRHunt. </p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-mobile"></i> The Client</h4>

        <p>The client makes use of a relatively new Web-oriented framework called
            <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="AngularJS Website">AngularJS</a> by leveraging the
            popular <a href="https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp" target="_blank" rel="ngbp">ngBoilerplate</a>
            build management system in combination with the mobile-first front-end framework, <a
                    href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-database"></i> The Server</h4>

        <p>The server is written in JavaScript for the synchronous event-driven framework
            <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="node">Node.js</a> and currently running on a Raspberry Pi
            (mini computer)
            somewhere in Townsville.
        </p>

        <p>Development time was reduced by utilising the
            <a href="http://mcavage.me/node-restify/" target="_blank" rel="restify">restify</a> and
            <a href="http://sequelizejs.com" target="_blank" rel="sequelize">Sequelize</a> modules for Node.js.</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">

        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> have been around since 1994, and are a very
            effective way of encoding information. You can generate your own QR code for a URL using free websites like
            <a href="http://www.qrcode-monkey.com/">QR-Code-Monkey</a>.</p>

        <p>Each of our QR Codes points to a unique URL in the QRHunt game, either an information page like this, or a
            specific code that you need to collect.</p>
