        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Why don't I need an account? </h4>

        <p>The web client uses a method known as <em>browser fingerprinting</em> to generate an identifier for the web
            browser without gathering any personal information. This methodology allows the system to identify, with up
            to 94% accuracy, which pages a player visits.</p>

        <p>This technique is often used by mobile advertisers to generate targeted advertisements.</p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-user"></i> How is the game ranked? </h4>

        <p>Each player has a <em>collected</em> number of scans linked to their player id, and a time stamp for each.
            The server tasked with tracking all players compares the total number of codes <em>collected</em> and a
            duration of time between the first and last code scanned.</p>

        <p>The players with a higher total of scans, in the shortest period of time win.</p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-qrcode"></i> Can I scan the same code twice? </h4>

        <p>Yes, and it is encouraged! Scanning the same code changes the duration between first and last unique
            scans.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Find all the codes and race between them to reduce your time!</strong></em></p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-mobile"></i> The Client</h4>

        <p>The client makes use of a relatively new web orientated framework called
            <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="AngularJS Website">AngularJS</a> by leveraging the
            popular <a href="https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp" target="_blank" rel="ngbp">ngBoilerplate</a>
            build management system in combination with the mobile-first front-end framework, <a
                    href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>

        <h4 class=""><i class="fa fa-database"></i> The Server</h4>

        <p>The server is written in JavaScript for the synchronous event driven framework
            <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="node">Node.js</a> and currently running on a RaspberryPi
            somewhere in Townsville.
        </p>

        <p>Development time was reduced by utilising the
            <a href="http://mcavage.me/node-restify/" target="_blank" rel="restify">restify</a> and
            <a href="http://sequelizejs.com" target="_blank" rel="sequelize">Sequelize</a> modules for Node.js.</p>
