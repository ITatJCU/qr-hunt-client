        <h4><i class="fa fa-question"></i> What do I need to scan these codes?</h4>

        <p>Your mobile phone will need an app capable of reading the QR Codes for you. There are
            many capable apps available, however we recommend: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i class="fa fa-android"></i> <a
                    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=la.droid.qr.priva&hl=en" target="_blank">QR
                Droid Private</a>
                for Android Devices
            </li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-apple"></i> <a
                    href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/qr-code-reader-by-scan/id698925807?mt=8" target="_blank">QR

                for iOS Devices
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Both of these apps are free.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-gift"></i> Are there prizes?</h4>

        <p>Indeed there are! Every hour (1, 2, 3 and 4pm), a IT@JCU will give out one <strong>16GB iPod Nano</strong> to
            the highest
            person on the leaderboard who is present (building 134).</p>

        </p>You can also collect a nice small prize after you have scanned 20% of the codes available. Come to the IT
